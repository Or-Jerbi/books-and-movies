# Books and Movies - Data Science Final Project

The main goal of this project is to determine if itâ€™s possible to predict which book was turned into a movie based on the available data. We use various data science techniques to approach this problem.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of books and movies.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and cleaning the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights through data analysis and visualizations.
4. **Machine Learning**: Building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict the book based on movie data.
